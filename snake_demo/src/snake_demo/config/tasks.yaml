    Instructions:
    ------------
    {game_description}

    - The player should be represented using a **blue rectangle**.
    - The enemy should be represented using a **red circle**.
    - The bullet should be represented using a **green rectangle**.
    - Do NOT use images, only use `pygame.draw` functions.
    - The final answer must be the **full Python code**, with no explanations.

  expected_output: >
    A fully functional Python script implementing the game using `pygame.draw` for all objects.
